# 👋 Hi, I’m @mistycmissy
✨ Event sorceress, ritual alchemist, and sponsorship funding conjurer. I’m a multidimensional creative who lives at the intersection of sound healing, brand strategy, and cosmic code activation.
👀 I’m interested in crafting transformational experiences — from wellness festivals and moon ceremonies to futuristic brand universes that glow under blacklight and leave people talking in hashtags.
🌱 I’m currently learning even deeper integrations of astrology, human design, and AI automation (yes, I know my transits *and* my tech stack).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on immersive events, healing experiences, community projects, and branded rituals that *actually* resonate. If you're building something meaningful, wild, or soul-shaking — let's talk.
📫 How to reach me: [linktr.ee/mistycmissy](https://linktr.ee/mistycmissy) or drop into my DMs like Mercury Retrograde into your ex’s inbox.
😄 Pronouns: she/her (also accepts "your cosmic consultant")
⚡ Fun fact: I’ve got something spellbinding in the works... a not-so-secret project coded in moonlight, myth, and magick. It’s not ready to launch, but when it does? The stars themselves will RSVP. 🌕
